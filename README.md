# My config files for [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org)

This repository contains my config files for Hammerspoon. This config
has already replaced my use of the following apps:

- [ClipMenu](http://www.clipmenu.com) (not fully, only supports text
  entries) - see [clipboard.lua](https://github.com/zzamboni/hammerspoon-config/blob/master/clipboard.lua)
- [Breakaway](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/23361/breakaway) (only
  for Spotify at the moment, and it needs latest Hammerspoon built
  from source) - see [audio.lua](https://github.com/zzamboni/hammerspoon-config/blob/master/audio.lua)
- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com) (only some shortcuts
  implemented, those that I use, but others should be easy to add) -
  see [windows.lua](https://github.com/zzamboni/hammerspoon-config/blob/master/windows.lua)
- [ShowyEdge](https://pqrs.org/osx/ShowyEdge/index.html.en) (again,
  only the indicators I use are implemented, but others are very easy
  to add) - see
  [keyboard.lua](https://github.com/zzamboni/hammerspoon-config/blob/master/keyboard.lua)

It has drawn inspiration and code from many other places, including:

- https://github.com/victorso/.hammerspoon/blob/master/tools/clipboard.lua
- https://github.com/cmsj/hammerspoon-config/
- https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/wiki/Sample-Configurations
