# hammerspoon-config
My config files for Hammerspoon (http://www.hammerspoon.org)

This repository contains my config files for Hammerspoon. This config has already replaced my use of:

- ClipMenu
- Breakaway
- Spectacle

It has drawn inspiration and code from many other places, including:

- https://github.com/victorso/.hammerspoon/blob/master/tools/clipboard.lua
- https://github.com/cmsj/hammerspoon-config/
